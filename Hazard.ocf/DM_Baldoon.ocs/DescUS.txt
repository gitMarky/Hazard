After the daughter of Sir James Dalrymple died in 1669 inside the walls of this old building, legends assure, that the ruins are cursed. 1989 the Castle was purchased by a BioTech company because of its special geographical position. A laboratory was established. People say, it was abused by conducting cruel experiments on Clonks. 18 years later, the whole research-team suddenly disappeared.
